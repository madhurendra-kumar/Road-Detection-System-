# Road-Detection-System-
This project is aimed at developing a road detection system using Python. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to identify
and delineate roads from images or video streams. Road detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as autonomous driving, 
navigation systems, and traffic analysis.
Features
Detection of roads in images and video streams
Support for various input sources including images and videos.
Modular design for easy integration into other projects.

Python
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)
NumPy (Numerical Python)
Matplotlib (Plotting Library)
